                <p>Philosopher is a universal font inspired from Agfa Roots and ITC Binary. It was initially published
                    with
                    intentional errors to encourage designers to move from passive use to true incorporation. Over time
                    the
                    errors were corrected, and today, it is used by millions.</p>

            <p style="font-size:12px">Philosophy is the pursuit of wisdom and understanding through critical thinking and rational
                inquiry. It explores fundamental questions about the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, and the meaning of life. Throughout history, numerous philosophers have made profound contributions to this field,
                shaping our understanding of the world and influencing various aspects of society.</p>
                <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.5">Socrates is often considered the father of Western philosophy. He believed that true wisdom comes from self-examination and questioning one's own beliefs. His method of dialectical questioning, known as
                the Socratic method, aimed to stimulate critical thinking and uncover the underlying truths within
                individuals. Socrates famously declared, "An unexamined life is not worth living," emphasizing the
                importance of introspection and the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
                <p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2">Aristotle was a student of Plato and is renowned for his work in ethics, politics, and natural
                sciences. He believed in the concept of eudaimonia, often translated as "happiness" or "flourishing."
                Aristotle argued that living a virtuous life, characterized by the pursuit of moral excellence and the
                cultivation of intellectual and moral virtues, is the path to true happiness. His contributions to metaphysics and the scientific method also had a profound impact on Western thought. </p>

            <div class="short">
                <p style="font-size:12px">Kant was a German philosopher who greatly influenced modern philosophy. His work on
                ethics, particularly in his "Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals," introduced the idea of
                the categorical imperative. Kant argued that moral actions should be guided by principles
                that could be universally applied without contradiction. He emphasized the importance of
                acting out of a sense of duty rather than mere inclination, asserting that individuals have an
                inherent moral duty to respect the dignity of all human beings.</p>
                <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.5">Rousseau was a French philosopher known for his contributions to political philosophy
                and social contract theory. He believed that society, through the process of civilization,
                corrupted individuals and created inequality. Rousseau's concept of the social contract
                proposed that individuals should collectively agree to live under a common set of rules
                and laws, preserving their freedom and equality. His ideas played a pivotal role in shaping
                the Enlightenment era and had a profound influence on political thought, including the
                French Revolution.</p>
                <p style="font-size:20px; line-height:2">These philosophers, among many others, have left an enduring legacy in the world of
                philosophy, each contributing unique perspectives and ideas that continue to shape our
                understanding of the human experience and the world around us.</p>
